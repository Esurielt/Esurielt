- 👋 Hi, I’m @Esurielt
- 👀 I’m interested in Game development and Realtime rendering of 3D character and environments, especially stylized rendering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot more about Unreal Engine 4 and its relevant DCC pipeline. I'm also trying to learn more about Houdini and plugin writing for Blender and Maya.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Game Dev related stuff and stylized rendering projects!
- 📫 Reach me on Twitter or ArtStation @Esurielt!
